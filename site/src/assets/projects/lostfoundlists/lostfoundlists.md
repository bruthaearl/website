 # Lost + Found Lists
 
 Both my brother and I worked in grocery stores back in college. On occasion, we'd come acress shopping lists that were either lost or discarded by customers. I always found these lists incredibly candid; customers created these lists without ever expecting another person to read them. These lsits were penned in a shorthand known only to the shopper, often on stationery that was likely chosen by nearest reach. It was always an interesting exercise trying to piece together a customer's menu and, by extension, life. It's G-rated voyeurism.

 I saved all of these lists and finally found the time to scan them in. All 61 of them can be found on my mini-blog, [Lost + Found Lists](https://lostandfoundlists.tumblr.com/).
